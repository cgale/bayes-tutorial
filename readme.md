# Bayesian tutorial journal clubs

These introductory sessions are given as journal clubs in the McGill Nuclear Theory group by Matthew Heffernan, using resources lightly, if at all, modified from Dick Furnstahl's excellent course at The Ohio State University.

## Installation
This contains the instructions for installation. 

First, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.

Next, we create a virtual environment for the purposes of these tutorials so any installations do not interfere with any local packages. To do this, first:

    python3 -m venv bayes-tutorial
    source bayes-tutorial/bin/activate
    
This will create and activate your virtual environment.

Now, install the required packages:

    pip -r requirements-bayestutorial.txt

This may take a while, but at the end, we should be ready to procede.

All of the notebooks we will use should be run from within the virtual environment.
To activate:

    source bayes-tutorial/bin/activate

To deactivate:

    deactivate
